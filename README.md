Hey there,thanks for stopping by,to use this app,you can either download this project and use python manage.py runserver in vscode or pycharm to run the app on your localhost,
or you can pull it's docker image by this command,docker pull sadrajaf77/eshop:latest and the create a container for it.
there is also a dockerfile in the projects main directory,use that to create your own image for this app if you needed to.
